# G.L.Y.P.H.A.E. - ***G***ame-based ***L***earning ***Y***ields ***P***honetic ***H***ieroglyphs of ***A***ncient ***E***gyptian


## :page_facing_up: Description

GLYPHAE is an Android mobile game designed to make learning Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs fun and engaging. Inspired by the Tamagotchi-style gameplay, players raise an Egyptian god from an egg to their godly form by fulfilling their various needs: hunger, health, joy, and energy.

Each need is met by playing games that teach the player hieroglyphs through a [Leitner-flashcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)-inspired memory system. As you progress, the difficulty increases and new mini-games become available, reflecting the [five steps of second language acquisition described by Stephen Krashen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-language_acquisition#Stages).
