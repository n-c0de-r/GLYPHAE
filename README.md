# G.L.Y.P.H.A.E. - ***G***ame-based ***L***earning ***Y***ields ***P***honetic ***H***ieroglyphs of ***A***ncient ***E***gyptian


## :page_facing_up: Description

GLYPHAE is an Android mobile game designed to make learning Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs fun and engaging. Inspired by the Tamagotchi-style gameplay, players raise an Egyptian god from an egg to their godly form by fulfilling their various needs: hunger, health, joy, and energy.

Each need is met by playing games that teach the player hieroglyphs through a [Leitner-flashcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)-inspired memory system. As you progress, the difficulty increases and new mini-games become available, reflecting the [five steps of second language acquisition described by Stephen Krashen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-language_acquisition#Stages).

## :dart: Gameplay

### :heartpulse: Needs

- Hunger: Feed your pet hieroglyphs to still its hunger.
- Health: Engage in a game to heal your pet by matching hieroglyphs and letters in the correct order.
- Joy: Play various mini-games to entertain your pet and learn new hieroglyphs.
- Energy: Read a magic lullaby-spell to boost your pet’s energy, so you can play on.

When any of these needs drops below a threshold, your pet will notify you. Each notification serves as an opportunity to learn new hieroglyphs and evolve your pet to the next stage.

### :hatching_chick: Evolution

As your pet evolves, the following will happen:
- The difficulty of the mini-games will increase slightly
- Their needs will increase / decrease in a different manner
- Their appearance will change to show growth
- New games for the "joy" activity will become available
- These changes reflect the five steps of second language acquisition:
  1. Pre-production
  2. Early Production
  3. Speech Emergence
  4. Intermediate Fluency
  5. Advanced Fluency
